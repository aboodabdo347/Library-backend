## About the App
**Library App** is a digital platform designed for book enthusiasts. It facilitates the discovery of new books, enables users to track their reading progress, and share their literary experiences. Users can create and share lists of books they wish to read or have already read, making it easier to find recommendations and see what others are enjoying.

Additionally, users can write reviews for the books they've read, providing valuable insights and aiding others in their reading selections. These reviews can pertain to individual books or entire lists, nurturing a community of readers who exchange experiences and suggestions.

The Library App serves two primary user groups:
- **Readers**: Individuals who compile and share book lists.
- **Authors**: Writers who can publish their works on the platform.

Prioritizing security and user-friendliness, the Library App employs JWT authentication, ensuring that only registered users can access its features. It is an ideal choice for those passionate about reading and eager to engage with a like-minded community.
